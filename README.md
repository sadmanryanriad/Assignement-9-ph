# Welcome to <span style="color:green">Event Management</span> website.🙂

 ### Here are some main features and functionality of this website:
- **User-Friendly Navigation**: My event management website is built using React and React Router for smooth and one page navigation. You can easily explore different sections of the website, including service details, custom orders, and your cart without reloading the page. ✨

- **Secure Authentication**: I prioritize your security by implementing Firebase for user authentication. Your personal information and account details are kept safe and private in the firebase server. 🏢

- **Private Routes**: Only authenticated users can access these areas. Create your account to access private routes. you need to login to access: service details, cart and pricing. 💵

- **Cart Functionality**: Add items to your cart, and they will be saved in your local storage. The cart also calculates and displays the total price for your added items, making budgeting easier. 📁

- **Smooth User Experience**: I've integrated animations and smooth scrolling to enhance your overall user experience. I've used react Aos and react-scroll-to-top library to make the user interface more visually appealing. 😄

#### Summary: Although i'm extremely busy because of my university exams. But doing this project was extremely fun. I had to generate some unique ideas and collect free resources throughout the internet. The main and bonus requirement is completed. But I would have added more features if I had more time. Thank you <span style="color:purple">PH</span> 😊
